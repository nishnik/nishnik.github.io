Hello World!
My previous blog posts were at: [Global Class](http://nishantnikhil.weebly.com/).

You should try not to reinvent the wheel, So I thought it would be better for me to fork [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) repo and build this jekyll blog in minutes :smile: .

This is cool and the awesome most part is that **It is Markdown flavoured** . Its quite cool writing in markdown now. Oh! I remember how weird I felt writing in markdown back in December. Snap!

Now, I will search for a way to do spell correction in markdown. It is so much nedded, I know a little bit of googling will help me.

Happy Holi! :fire:
