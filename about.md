Hey there! I am Nishant Nikhil, an undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur majoring in Mathematics and Computing.

### More Information

I am quite enthusiastic about robotics and this year [KRSSG](http://www.krssg.in) is going to represent India in Robocup at 3D-Simulation League at Leipzig, Germany. I am artificial intelligence team member of Kharagpur Robo-Soccer Students' Group. I like competitive programming and have also done some application development in Android and Windows, front-end programming and back-end programming. One of my work is [Code-O-Soccer](http://event.krssg.in). I am always open for a talk and travel. And these days I am more into soft-computing tools than hard-computing tools.
